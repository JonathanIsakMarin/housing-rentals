# Housing rentals
There are so many houses being rented today. Through many different pages. Especially in the big cities everyone wants to get a nice place to live. With huge demand there is a chance that people who rent out their places might raise prices to a critical point. This is not very good. So i wondered if there were any way to calculate what at fair rent is for a house. Machine learning to the rescue! In this notebook I have scraped one of the largest danish sites for renting out houses and tried to predict the cost of rental.

The project is not entirely finished, but will be soon.
